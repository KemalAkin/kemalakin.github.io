An alternative to standard model of cosmology ($\Lambda \mathrm{-CDM}$) is developed through scalar field models of dark energy. Stability analysis of radiation-matter-quintescence models are performed using symbolic(SymPy and Mathematica) and numerical(NumPy and SciPy) methods. Trajectories in the phase space are visualized using matplotlib.
