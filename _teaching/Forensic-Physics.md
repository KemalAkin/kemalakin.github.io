The usual freshman course series Physics 101 and 102 are modified to provide more intuition by focusing applications on forensic sciences.

As the teaching assistant of the course, I conducted the whole laboratory sessions and a part of the theory classes. I was also responsible for preparing exam/homework questions and grading. Due to COVID-19 pandemics, the course was given online. In order to provide specific applications to forensic sciences, I created my own applications/simulations with Python & Excel.   

Some of the covered topics are:
* Physics and Measurement
* Vectors
* Motion in 1D and 3D
* Work, Energy and Momentum
* Conservation Laws and Ballistic Pendulum
* Harmonic Motion and Simple Pendulum 
* Introduction to Ballistics
* Reconstruction of Traffic Accidents
* Bloodstain Pattern Analysis
* EM Spectrum and Optics
