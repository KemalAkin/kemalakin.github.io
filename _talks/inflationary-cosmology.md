This talk consists of two parts: First, I briefly summarize the FRW cosmology and introduce scalar field models as an alternative to dark energy. In the second part, I demonstrate analysis of inflationary models within the context of GR and alternative theories of gravitation. I also introduce numerical techniques and computational tools to perform the analysis.
