This 1-hour talk serves as a introduction to markup languages, specifically to $\LaTeX$ which is a high-quality typesetting system that includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. Further, I demonstrate a simple document creation with $\LaTeX$ using TeXMaker in a Linux system.
